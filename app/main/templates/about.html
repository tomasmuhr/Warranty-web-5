                    Discovered Python thanks to the ESRI ArcGIS software when seeking a way to automate 
                    tedious and repetitive GIS tasks and routines. Enjoys learning new things, e.g. by 
                    making apps for fun.

                    sports. He also has a special love for playing board games, especially long and complex ones.
